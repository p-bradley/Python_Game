# Rock, Paper, Scissors

Pick your weapon and play the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: all you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0)

Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory - <code>cd directory</code> - and run the gamefinal.py file in a Python 3 Termincal for mac/Linux, or Git Bash on Windows.

The rules are the same as the original:
1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

Choose your weapon wisely!

You choose first, then the computer. Good Luck!

Built with Python 3.
